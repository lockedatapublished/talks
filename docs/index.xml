      <description>Is it worth putting your stuff on the cloud? Let&amp;rsquo;s talk numbers!
Abstract Yes, the cloud is cool. Yes, it can be easy. But… will it save or even make the company money? That is the all important question!
Learning to build a financial business case for a technology decision is a smart move. Transform the techy topic that C-suite people don’t feel like they can discuss into something they can discuss by making it a financial topic.</description>

      <description>Experience my pain as I try to build an Azure Data Platform that scales.
Abstract I worked in a startup and our volumes started small, really small. I was the data scientist but I needed to actually build a data platform first. By the end of 6 months, daily volumes were 2,000 times the size. This talk takes you through my 6 months of learning how to build a high-scale data platform whilst requirements, scale, and technology were all changing.</description>

      <description>Power BI is pretty nifty but it has some areas that R can help make easier.
Abstract This session will look at how PowerBI dashboard developers can use R to solve data import and data visualisation challenges.
By the end of this session, you’ll know how you can use R to connect to more data sources, do sophisticated data transformation easily, avoid spatial data point limitations, and build custom graphics.</description>

      <title>Data Science Executive Briefing</title>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/talks/post/data-science-executive-briefing/</guid>
      <description>Understand what data science is and isn&amp;rsquo;t, how you go from business goals to data science problems, and how you acquire talented data scientists.
Abstract Data science aims to use data to build processes that help automate away low-value work, help people take the most effective action, and help people adapt more quickly to changing circumstances. Data science is identifying when to send out engineers, which customers to talk to, and which patients to send to a consultant.</description>

      <title>R &amp; SQL Server for real-time predictions</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/talks/post/r-and-sql-server/</link>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/talks/post/r-and-sql-server/</guid>
      <description>Putting data science models with SQL Server can be a great and simple way to operationalise your data science models. Learn how to do it.
Abstract Embedding your R (and soon Python!) models in SQL Server enables you to add predictive capabilities to your applications and analytics in place of buying expensive components or making substantial changes to your systems. In this demo-packed talk, you&amp;rsquo;ll see how you can go from a model built in R to making predictions on the fly in SQL Server 2016.</description>

      <description>Learn about Docker and how you can store data in Docker containers safely.
Abstract If you’re like me, you like your data to stick around for a long time and most importantly you want to know it’s safe.
In the Docker world, there’s the maxim of “never patch”, always make a new container with the latest version of the application. If we’re sticking in our database in a container like Microsoft are doing with SQL Server now, what happens when we need to apply the latest patches?</description>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/talks/post/failing-my-way-to-success-with-azure/</guid>
      <description>Experience my pain as I try to build an Azure Data Platform that scales.
Abstract Azure is a constantly evolving area, with more new features per day than I could shake a stick at. It’s awesome, you can use PowerShell, it’s cheaper than tin. It’s the future, so they tell me. It’s also a real PITA when you’re trying to achieve a task and you don’t know which bit is best!</description>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/talks/post/anchor-models/</guid>
      <description>Yes, there&amp;rsquo;s normal forms beyond third, and yes they can be really useful!
Abstract Anchor Modelling is a fantastic database modelling paradigm that uses sixth normal form (6NF) to store data and provides third normal form (3NF) views for ease of use.
This session deep dives into all the concepts behind Anchor Modelling (and indeed databases generally!) and then takes you through how Anchor Modelling uses these concepts to move away from the traditional data warehouse paradigm to deliver a purely additive, agile database.</description>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/talks/post/logistic-regressions-in-r/</guid>
      <description>Learn what logistic regressions are. See how we can use R to prepare data, build models, and evaluate them.
Abstract Learn about a fundamental type of model used to make classification prredictions and probabilities of an outcome&amp;rsquo;s likelihood.
Logistic regressions are a core model in machine learning, inherited from statistics, and it&amp;rsquo;s vital to understand them if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in data science.
The neat thing is they&amp;rsquo;re pretty simple!</description>
