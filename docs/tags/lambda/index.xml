      <description>Experience my pain as I try to build an Azure Data Platform that scales.
Abstract I worked in a startup and our volumes started small, really small. I was the data scientist but I needed to actually build a data platform first. By the end of 6 months, daily volumes were 2,000 times the size. This talk takes you through my 6 months of learning how to build a high-scale data platform whilst requirements, scale, and technology were all changing.</description>
