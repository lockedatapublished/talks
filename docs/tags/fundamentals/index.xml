      <description>Understand what data science is and isn&amp;rsquo;t, how you go from business goals to data science problems, and how you acquire talented data scientists.
Abstract Data science aims to use data to build processes that help automate away low-value work, help people take the most effective action, and help people adapt more quickly to changing circumstances. Data science is identifying when to send out engineers, which customers to talk to, and which patients to send to a consultant.</description>
