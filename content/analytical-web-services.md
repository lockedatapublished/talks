"Works on my machine" isn't useful - learn how we can get our models into production.

## Abstract
In your day job you build some awesome bit of analysis in R but now people want this information available real time and against every thing that comes into the business - you need an R web service but not being a developer you have no clue how to go about it.

This session takes you through how to convert your analysis into a web service and how to take into account important stuff like security, scalability and error handling. We discuss the technologies and the defensive programming you should be using to help get you through.
