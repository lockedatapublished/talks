Let's talk ethics

## Abstract
 
We want to do no harm but sometimes our models have unintended consequences. Come learn about some of the ethical challenges we as data scientists may face, how we can put checklists and frameworks around ourselves to help ensure we donâ€™t do unethical things accidentally, and what tools we can use to check our models for issues.
