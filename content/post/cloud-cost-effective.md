Is it worth putting your stuff on the cloud? Let's talk numbers!

## Abstract
Yes, the cloud is cool. Yes, it can be easy. But… will it save or even make the company money? That is the all important question!

Learning to build a financial business case for a technology decision is a smart move. Transform the techy topic that C-suite people don’t feel like they can discuss into something they can discuss by making it a financial topic. Help people make the right decision for the business.

In this talk, we’ll look at how we can determine the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and any potential Return on Investment (ROI) for a variety of scenarios, from starting in the cloud, migrating to the cloud, and staying on premises.

We’ll see if there are any tipping points when one or the other becomes sensible. We’ll take into account basic principles like the future value of money, and even incorporate a measurement of opportunity costs for implementing each solution.

By the end of this talk, you’ll have a grasp of basic accounting and you’ll be able to talk business i.e. money!
