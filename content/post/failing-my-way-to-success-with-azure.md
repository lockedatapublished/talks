Experience my pain as I try to build an Azure Data Platform that scales.

## Abstract
Azure is a constantly evolving area, with more new features per day than I could shake a stick at. It’s awesome, you can use PowerShell, it’s cheaper than tin. It’s the future, so they tell me. It’s also a real PITA when you’re trying to achieve a task and you don’t know which bit is best!
This talk takes you through my path to a cool analytics platform, showing you where, how, and why I failed. I’ll show you the gotchas, the ways to quickly prototype a solution, and how to clean up after you make a mess.
