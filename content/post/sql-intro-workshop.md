SQL is an important skill for everyone!

## Abstract
Learn SQL from the comfort of RStudio in this 2.5 hour hands-on workshop. Using SQLite as our database of choice, we'll learn the fundamentals of good data structures, querying single datasets, and combining multiple datasets for getting answers from across your database. Bring your laptop with RStudio and we'll send more info closer to the date on packages to install.
