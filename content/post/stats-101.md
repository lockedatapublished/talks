Take a visual, intuitive tour through some important concepts of statistics.

## Abstract
We can be better at our jobs if we have a good grasp of basic statistics.

It doesn’t matter if you’re a DBA looking to understand query plan performance, a data warehouse person needing to come up with ETL load time estimates, or an analyst needing to report figures to managers. Statistics can help you all.

If only maths classes hadn’t been so darn boring!

Instead of going all mathsy, we’ll be doing some real-time data capture and taking an intuitive and visual approach through summary statistics right up to understanding how to produce simple predictive models.

By the end of the session, you’ll understand concepts like sampling, error, regression, and outliers – important day-to-day stuff and a great base upon which to build. By the end of the session, you’ll wonder how people could have it made seem so hard for so many years.
