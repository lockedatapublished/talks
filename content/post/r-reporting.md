What does it take to use R for reporting?

## Abstract
Urgh! There’s data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and tons of buzz words flying around that make R & Python sound like you need a big fat budget to hire a bevvy of boffins and racks of servers.

This isn’t the case. R is actually a really nice, practical language that you can use to do ETL and reporting. You can do it for free and you don’t even need a Coursera course in stats to be able to use it.

In this talk, we’re going to look at how we can get started using R for reporting.

We’ll look at building dashboards, from connecting to our database, wrangling our data, to presenting good looking charts back to the user.
