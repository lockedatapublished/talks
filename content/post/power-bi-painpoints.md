Power BI is pretty nifty but it has some areas that R can help make easier.

## Abstract
This session will look at how PowerBI dashboard developers can use R to solve data import and data visualisation challenges.

By the end of this session, youâ€™ll know how you can use R to connect to more data sources, do sophisticated data transformation easily, avoid spatial data point limitations, and build custom graphics.
