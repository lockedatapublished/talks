Learn what logistic regressions are. See how we can use R to prepare data, build models, and evaluate them.

## Abstract
Learn about a fundamental type of model used to make classification prredictions and probabilities of an outcome's likelihood. 

Logistic regressions are a core model in machine learning, inherited from statistics, and it's vital to understand them if you're interested in data science. 

The neat thing is they're pretty simple! 

Learn about how they works and how you go about programming a logistic regression from end to end in R.
