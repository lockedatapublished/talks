Learn the fundamentals of R.

## Abstract
R, the statistical programming language, is another open-source program making inroads into the Microsoft world.

R was originally for doing stats, but it now does database CRUD, reporting, documentation, and even websites.  It can be awkward to know where to start, so this session fast tracks you to the sections you need to know about to save yourself pains you didn't even know you had.
