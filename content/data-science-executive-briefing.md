Understand what data science is and isn't, how you go from business goals to data science problems, and how you acquire talented data scientists.

## Abstract
Data science aims to use data to build processes that help automate away low-value work, help people take the most effective action, and help people adapt more quickly to changing circumstances. Data science is identifying when to send out engineers, which customers to talk to, and which patients to send to a consultant. Data science is saving people money and helping them make more of it.

In this briefing, we'll join the dots between the challenges your organisation is facing and data science to help you determine if data science is a good strategic fit. We'll then go on to provide tactical advice from the field to help you deliver a data science initiative successfully.
