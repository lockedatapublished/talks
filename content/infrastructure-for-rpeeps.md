It's important to know how to work your operating systems -- if only so you know how to avoid working with your operating systems!

## Abstract
Continuous integration, Docker, openCPU, shiny server, RStudio server, Microsoft R Server, R in Hadoop, your laptop, your grid computer ... There's a lot of infrastructure out there and someone has to configure it. This session whistle-stops through networking, Linux basics, and other key concepts to help get you up to speed because one day, the person configuring the server could be you.
