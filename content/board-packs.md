Making complex report compilation easy is something we can do in R. Learn how!

## Abstract
The monthly report pack for the Board -- with lots of information from different sources and all requiring commentary from lots of people -- these things can take weeks to produce, send for commentary, and then compile into one pack. 
This full hour takes you through a framework for a single core source document, a shiny interface, hooks into the database for commentary, and the LaTeX (or markdown) document structure needed for developing a single interface through which lots of people can contribute to a single document.
