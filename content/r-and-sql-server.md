Putting data science models with SQL Server can be a great and simple way to operationalise your data science models. Learn how to do it.

## Abstract
Embedding your R (and soon Python!) models in SQL Server enables you to add predictive capabilities to your applications and analytics in place of buying expensive components or making substantial changes to your systems. In this demo-packed talk, you'll see how you can go from a model built in R to making predictions on the fly in SQL Server 2016.
